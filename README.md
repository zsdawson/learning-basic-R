# learning-basic-R

this will be added too more but more of a repo for my learning and storage for all my R related content, there will be no qualitty controle what so ever 
  
  
this will have r from my personal teachings, an upcomming class about data science and a extremly helpful mentor i will try my best to keep these semi orginized with hopefully some type of daily progres

im tempted to move on with this as well as python becuase of the simaliarties but there are some style problems as well as the over all difretnt type of coding
